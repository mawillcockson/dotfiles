# Tasks for changes that need to be made in general

- codify temporary ncspot login-flow
- Add idempotence to existing nu setup module
- find a way to get periodic notifications on which software projects have
released a new version, primarily on GitHub
- `package install` doesn't give a great error message when trying to `do
$install 'package'` and the `'package'` cites a package manager that isn't
implemented for the current platform
