# Debian pre-requisites

By default, Debian doesn't have `pip` installed, which the setup needs. The following command may install it:

```sh
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests python3-pip
```

[Continue with the rest of the setup.](~/README.md#continue)
