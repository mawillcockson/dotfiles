- disable fzf-native build without cmake
- add ability to test `use setup; setup` in qemu, like how nix does some tests
  - testing on windows would be super cool
    - maybe GitHub Actions?
    - command I can run on a machine with 4GB would be the coolest
  - would probably need a `--skip-fonts` option, since that would require a password, but maybe just the fonts could be dual encrypted with a GitHub or other token / secret
- fix font in alacritty
- allow alacritty to run via nixpkgs
- git should be configured to require signing, but it's not
- gpg has more commands that let trust and such be configured
  - the entire `gpg_setup.sh` might be able to be automated now?
- configure kde settings, like Win+` keyboard shortcut
